### Overview
NiceKitty is a delightful CSS and JavaScript animation of a cat with a realistically moving tail. This project showcases what can be achieved with pure web technologies and AI collaboration.

### Features
- Fluid Tail Animation: The cat's tail moves in an elegant S-curve pattern that transitions smoothly between shapes, mimicking the natural movement of a real cat's tail.
- Blinking Eyes: The cat blinks periodically, adding to its lifelike appearance.
- Pure CSS Styling: All visual elements are created using CSS, without any external images.
- Responsive Design: The animation looks great on various screen sizes.

### AI Generation Process
This entire project was created through AI collaboration using GitHub Copilot. The process included:

- Initial generation of the basic cat structure with CSS
- Multiple iterations to perfect the tail's movement physics
- Fine-tuning the animation timing and curves
- Refining the S-curve pattern to mimic natural cat tail movement

The most challenging part was creating a realistic tail animation that:
- Keeps the root fixed at the cat's body
- Transforms smoothly between S-shape, straight line, and reverse S-shape
- Maintains fluid motion without any jarring transitions or sharp angles

After several iterations, we achieved a natural-looking motion by combining sine and cosine functions with carefully calibrated parameters.

### Technical Details
- The tail's motion is achieved using SVG path animation with cubic Bezier curves
- JavaScript dynamically updates the SVG path parameters based on sine and cosine functions
- The animation uses requestAnimationFrame for smooth performance
- No external libraries or dependencies used

### How to Use
Simply open the HTML file in any modern web browser to see the animated cat.
